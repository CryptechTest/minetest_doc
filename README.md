# Documentation System
This mod provides a simple and highly extensible formspec in which the user
can access help pages about various things and the modder can add those pages.
The mod itself does not provide any help texts, just the framework.

Current version: 0.4.0

## For users
To open the help, there are multiple ways:

- Say “/help” in chat. This always works.
- If you use Unified Inventory, click on the book icon in the inventory menu

The documentation system itself should be more or less self-explanationary.

This mod is useless on its own, you will only need this mod as a dependency
for mods which actually add some help entries.

## For modders and subgame authors
This mod helps you in writing extensive documentation for your mod or subgame.
You can write about basically anything in the presentation you prefer.

To get started, read `API.md` in the directory of this mod.
